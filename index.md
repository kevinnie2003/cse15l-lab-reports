# Welcome to the First lab of CSE 15L by Kevin Nie!
*This is an tutorial about how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.*

1. First, you should download Virtual Studio Code. This is a very powerful tool.
   [VS Code Download Link](https://code.visualstudio.com)

2. After installing VS Code, you should use your computer to connect remotely. Your account name is available at [here](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). You may want to reset your password, but wait for 15 minutes or so before trying to log in.
3. Open a new terminal in VS Code, enter 
```
ssh cs15lsp23??@ieng6.ucsd.edu
# where "??" is your identical two letter of your account
```
   Then you should enter "yes" to use your password to log in. After entering your password correctly, you will log in and see a similar output:

4. Try some commands now! Here is an example where I want to enter one of my classmates' directory but got "permission denied". Then I change to the public directory and listed the files there.
